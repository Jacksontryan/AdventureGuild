This is the github repo for my game Adventure Guild. It is currently a work in progress, as I am currently working on creating a randomly generated map, then plan to move on to adventurers, classes, a level system, missions etc.
If you have any suggestions, send an email to godsdiscordkitten912@gmail.com
